    This command is intended to run as frequently as specified in a crontab. The window of time used
    to select requests to include in the email starts from the time this is last run to present.
    The last run time is stored in the
    last_remind_date field on the SubsidyRequestCustomerConfiguration model. This gives us 100%
    coverage of requests to email about, and also
    gives us fault tolerance if this ever fails. We can simply rerun this
    and to capture all subsidy requests that haven't been included in an email yet.

    This DOESN'T give us fine grained control of different enterprises wanting different
    email frequencies, but that's not part of the MVP. If and when we would want that, we
    can simply give config models a field that holds how frequently admins want to be notified
    and then update the cronjob to run more frequently (a "higher resolution") to let us
    include all use cases.
