    Creates or updates an allocated assignment record

      * If the existing record is allocated or accepted, don't do anything with the record

      - ``assignment_configuration``: The AssignmentConfiguration record under which assignments should be allocated.

      - ``content_key``: Typically a *course* key to which the learner is assigned.
      - ``content_price_cents``: The cost of redeeming the content, in USD cents, at the time of allocation. Should
        always be an integer >= 0.
